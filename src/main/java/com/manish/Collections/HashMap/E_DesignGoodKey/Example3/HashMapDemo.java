/*
Why immutable objects make a good key
It is not mandatory for a HashMap key to be immutable, but it is suggested that key objects are immutable. Immutability allows us to get the same hash code every time for a key object.

All the wrapper classes such as String, Integer, etc., are immutable, so they are considered good key candidates.

Letâ€™s look at an example to understand what happens when a key object is not immutable. In the below example, we are using an Employee object as a key. After inserting the employee object into the HashMap, we will make a change in the Employee object. After that, we will try to get the value for this key from the HashMap.
