### Callable Interface
In the previous sections we used the Runnable interface as the abstraction for tasks that were submitted to the executor service. The Runnable interface's sole run method doesn't return a value, which is a handicap for tasks that don't want to write results to global or shared datastructures. The interface Callable allows such tasks to return results. Let's see the definition of the interface first.
```java
public interface Callable<V> {
    /**
     * Computes a result, or throws an exception if unable to do so.
     *
     * @return computed result
     * @throws Exception if unable to compute a result
     */
    V call() throws Exception;
}
```
Note the interface also allows a task to throw an exception. A task goes through the various stages of its life which include the following:

- created
- submitted
- started
- completed

Let's say we want to compute the sum of numbers from 1 to n. Our task should accept an integer n and spit out the sum. Below are two ways to implement our task.
```java
  class SumTask implements Callable<Integer> {

        int n;

        public SumTask(int n) {
            this.n = n;
        }

        public Integer call() throws Exception {

            if (n <= 0)
                return 0;

            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                sum += i;
            }
            
            return sum;
        }
    }
```
 
Or we could take advantage of the anonymous class feature in the Java language to declare our task like so:
```java

      final int n = 10
      Callable<Integer> sumTask = new Callable<Integer>() {
        
          public Integer call() throws Exception {
              int sum = 0;
              for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
                sum += i;
              return sum;
          }
      };
```
Now we know how to represent our tasks using the Callable interface. In the next section we'll explore the Future interface which will help us manage a task's lifecycle as well as retrieve results from it.
