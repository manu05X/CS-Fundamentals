Ride Sharing Application - Low Level Design
---

## Features:
- The application allows users to share rides on a route.
- Users can either offer a shared ride (Driver) or consume a shared ride (Passenger).
- Users can search and select one from multiple available rides on a route with the same source and destination.

## Requirements:
Application should allow user onboarding.
1. add_user(user_detail) : Add basic user details
2. add_vehicle(vehicle_detail) : Add the userâ€™s vehicle(s) details
   User should be able to offer a shared ride on a route with details.
3. offer_ride(ride_detail)
   Ride will have details like vehicle, origin, destination, available seats. (A ride will have no intermediate
   stops.)
   Users can select a ride from multiple offered rides using a selection strategy.
   (A user can only request a ride (only for 1 or 2 people))
4. select_ride(source, destination, seats, selection_strategy)
   Preferred Vehicle (Activa/Polo/XUV)
   Most Vacant.
   System should be able to end the ride. User can only offer a ride for a given
   vehicle, once there are no active offered rides for that vehicle.
5. end_ride(ride_details)
   Find total rides offered/taken by all users.
6. print_ride_stats()

---

```

### Key Components Explained:
1. Geospatial Index (Geo):
   - Uses R-tree or Geohash to quickly find vehicles within a radius.
   - Example: Redis GEO or PostGIS.
2. Location Cache (Cache):
   - Stores real-time vehicle locations (updated every 5-10 sec via WebSocket).
   - Structure: vehicle_id â†’ {latitude, longitude, timestamp} â€¢
3. ETA Calculation:
    ```python
    def calculate_eta(passenger_loc, vehicle_loc):
        # Uses map APIs (Google Maps/OSRM) or Haversine formula
        return distance_in_minutes
    ```
3. Database Filtering:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM vehicles 
    WHERE id IN ([V1,V2,V3]) 
    AND status = 'AVAILABLE'
    AND last_activity > NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes';
    ```

### Real-Time Flow:
1. Passenger's app sends current GPS coordinates.
2. System finds vehicles in radius using geospatial index.
3. Filters only available vehicles from DB.
4. Returns results with ETAs based on cached locations.
5. Updates map in real-time via WebSocket (not shown).
   
### Optimizations:
   - Caching: Vehicle locations are ephemeral (volatile data).
   - Batching: Fetch locations for multiple vehicles in one call.
   - Geofencing: Reject queries outside service areas early.

```Sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- 1. Lock the ride row to prevent concurrent bookings
SELECT * FROM rides WHERE ride_id = 'R1' AND status = 'ACTIVE' FOR UPDATE;

-- 2. Check seat availability
UPDATE rides 
SET available_seats = available_seats - 1 
WHERE ride_id = 'R1' AND available_seats >= 1;

-- 3. If update affected 1 row, proceed to book
INSERT INTO ride_bookings (...) VALUES (...);
COMMIT;
```


Key Points:

Use FOR UPDATE to lock the row.

Check seat availability in the same transaction.

Rollback if seats are unavailable.
