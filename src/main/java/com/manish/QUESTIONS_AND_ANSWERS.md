## Answers

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
1. The four main pillars of Object-Oriented Programming are:
   - **Encapsulation:** It is the process of hiding the internal implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary features through public interfaces.
   - **Inheritance:** It allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass).
   - **Polymorphism:** It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling code reusability and flexibility.
   - **Abstraction:** It is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them into smaller, manageable parts, and hiding the unnecessary details.

2. Abstraction in Java is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly and may have abstract methods (methods without a body) that must be implemented by the concrete subclasses. Abstraction helps in providing a clear and well-defined interface for interacting with objects, hiding the underlying complexities.

3. Inheritance is an OOP concept where a class (subclass) inherits properties and behaviors from another class (superclass). It promotes code reuse and helps in building hierarchical relationships between classes. Composition, on the other hand, is when a class contains objects of other classes as its members to achieve the required functionality. The main difference is that inheritance creates an "is-a" relationship, while composition creates a "has-a" relationship between classes.

4. Access modifiers in Java control the visibility and accessibility of class members (fields, methods, and nested classes). There are four types of access modifiers in Java:
   - **public:** The member is accessible from any class.
   - **protected:** The member is accessible within the same package and subclasses in different packages.
   - **default (no modifier):** The member is accessible only within the same package.
   - **private:** The member is accessible only within the same class.

**Java Internals:**
1. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that allows Java bytecode to be executed on any platform. It provides an abstraction layer between Java programs and the underlying hardware. The JVM is responsible for memory management, garbage collection, and bytecode execution.

2. Java handles memory management through automatic memory allocation and garbage collection. When objects are created in Java, memory is allocated from the heap. The garbage collector automatically identifies and frees the memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use, preventing memory leaks.

3. The stack is used for storing method invocations and local variables. Each thread in Java has its own stack. The heap is used for dynamically allocated objects, and all objects share the same heap space. Objects in the heap can be accessed by multiple threads.

4. Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation is a technique used by the JVM to improve Java code performance. Instead of interpreting the entire bytecode, the JVM identifies frequently executed code paths and translates them into machine code at runtime. This reduces the execution overhead and leads to faster performance.

**Threading:**
1. A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Multithreading in Java allows multiple threads to execute concurrently, enabling efficient utilization of CPU resources.

2. The main difference between a thread and a process is that a process has its own memory space and resources, whereas threads of the same process share the same memory space and resources.

3. To create and start a thread in Java, you can either implement the `Runnable` interface or extend the `Thread` class. Here's an example using the `Runnable` interface:

   ```java
   public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
       public void run() {
           // Code to be executed in the thread
       }
   }

   // Creating and starting the thread
   Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
   thread.start();
   ```

4. Thread synchronization is used to ensure that multiple threads can safely access shared resources without causing data corruption or inconsistency. Common synchronization mechanisms in Java include `synchronized` keyword, `Lock` interface, and `Semaphore`.

**Design Principles and Patterns:**
1. The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that help in writing maintainable and scalable code:
   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single responsibility.
   - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
   - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
   - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

2. The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is used in scenarios where only one instance is required throughout the application.

3. The Observer design pattern is used to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects, where the subject (observable) notifies its observers (listeners) of any state changes. It is commonly used in event handling and GUI frameworks.

4. The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It promotes loose coupling between classes and makes the code more extensible.

**Exception Handling:**
1. Java handles exceptions using try-catch blocks. Checked exceptions must be caught or declared in the method signature, while unchecked exceptions do not need to be explicitly caught or declared. Checked exceptions are usually used for recoverable errors, while unchecked exceptions are for programming errors.

2. The "finally" block in exception handling is used to ensure that certain code is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. It is typically used to release resources or perform cleanup operations.

3. The "throw" keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception, while the "throws" keyword is used in method declarations to specify that the method may throw one or more exceptions. The caller of such methods must handle the specified exceptions.

**Java Collections:**
1. ArrayList and LinkedList are two common implementations of the List interface in Java.
   - Use ArrayList when you need fast access to elements using index-based operations, as it uses an array to store elements.
   - Use LinkedList when you frequently add or remove elements from the beginning or middle of the list, as it provides efficient insertion and deletion operations.

2. The Iterator is an interface in Java that provides a way to iterate through the elements of a collection, such as List, Set, or Map. It allows traversal of the collection without exposing its underlying structure.

3. HashMap in Java is a hash table-based implementation of the Map interface. It works by using hash codes and bucketing to store key-value pairs, making the time complexity of common operations like get and put O(1) on average.

**Java Streams:**
1. Java Streams are a sequence of elements that support functional-style operations. They enable efficient and concise data processing tasks, such as filtering, mapping, and reducing, without the need for explicit loops.

2. Intermediate operations are operations that can be chained together to form a stream pipeline. They do not produce a final result on their own

 and are typically used for filtering or mapping elements.

3. An example of using Java Streams to filter a collection of objects based on a condition:

   ```java
   List<String> fruits = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "kiwi");

   List<String> filteredFruits = fruits.stream()
       .filter(fruit -> fruit.length() > 5)
       .collect(Collectors.toList());
   ```

**Java 8 Features:**
1. Some significant features introduced in Java 8 are:
   - **Lambda Expressions:** A concise way to represent anonymous functions, enabling functional programming in Java.
   - **Functional Interfaces:** Interfaces that have only one abstract method, used to enable lambda expressions.
   - **Default Methods:** Methods that have a default implementation in an interface, allowing backward compatibility when adding new methods to interfaces.
   - **Streams API:** A new API for processing collections of data using functional-style operations.

2. Functional interfaces are interfaces that have exactly one abstract method. The "@" symbol is used to indicate that an interface is a functional interface, and it helps in avoiding accidental addition of multiple abstract methods, which would break compatibility with lambda expressions.

3. Example of using lambda expressions in Java 8:

   ```java
   // Before Java 8
   new Thread(new Runnable() {
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Hello from a thread!");
       }
   }).start();

   // With lambda expression in Java 8
   new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Hello from a thread!")).start();
   ```
