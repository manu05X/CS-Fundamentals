# Design Patterns:

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software development problems. They provide a template for solving similar problems in different scenarios by providing a set of best practices and guidelines. These patterns help developers to write efficient, maintainable, and scalable code. Design patterns can be classified into three categories: creational patterns, structural patterns, and behavioral patterns. Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, structural patterns deal with object composition, and behavioral patterns deal with object communication and delegation.
