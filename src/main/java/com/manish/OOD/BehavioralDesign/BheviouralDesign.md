# Behavioral Design Patterns

#### Overview:

Behavioral design patterns address common issues related to object interaction and communication in a system. They provide flexible and efficient solutions to manage complex interactions between objects, ensuring that different parts of a system work together seamlessly.

### Key Behavioral Design Patterns:

### 1. Observer Pattern

- Defines a `one-to-many` dependency **between objects**.
- When one object (subject) **changes its state**, all dependents (observers) are **notified and updated automatically**.
- **Use case:** UI frameworks where multiple elements need to react to changes in one part of the system (e.g., event listeners in GUIs).

**Key Concepts**
1. **Subject**: The object that holds the state and is monitored by observers. It provides methods to attach, detach, and notify observers.
2. **Observer**: The objects that are notified when the subject's state changes. They implement an update method to handle updates from the subject.


**Implementation Steps in Java**

1. **Define the Subject Interface**: This interface includes methods for attaching, detaching, and notifying observers.
2. **Implement the Subject**: Create a concrete class that maintains a list of observers and implements the subject interface.
3. **Define the Observer Interface**: This interface declares the update method that will be called when the subject's state changes.
4. **Implement the Observers**: Create concrete observer classes that implement the observer interface and define the update method.


Example

Here is a simple example demonstrating the Observer pattern in Java:

Step 1: Define the Subject Interface

```java
// Step 1: Define the Subject Interface
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

interface Subject {
    void attach(Observer o);
    void detach(Observer o);
    void notifyObservers();
}

// Step 2: Implement the Subject
class ConcreteSubject implements Subject {
  private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
  private String state;

  public String getState() {
    return state;
  }

  public void setState(String state) {
    this.state = state;
    notifyObservers();
  }

  @Override
  public void attach(Observer o) {
    observers.add(o);
  }

  @Override
  public void detach(Observer o) {
    observers.remove(o);
  }

  @Override
  public void notifyObservers() {
    for (Observer o : observers) {
      o.update();
    }
  }
}
// Step 3: Define the Observer Interface
interface Observer {
  void update();
}
// Step 4: Implement the Observers
class ConcreteObserver implements Observer {
  private String name;
  private ConcreteSubject subject;

  public ConcreteObserver(String name, ConcreteSubject subject) {
    this.name = name;
    this.subject = subject;
    this.subject.attach(this);
  }

  @Override
  public void update() {
    System.out.println("Observer " + name + " notified. New state is: " + subject.getState());
  }
}
// Step 5: Client Code to Demonstrate the Observer Pattern
public class ObserverPatternDemo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ConcreteSubject subject = new ConcreteSubject();

    ConcreteObserver observer1 = new ConcreteObserver("Observer 1", subject);
    ConcreteObserver observer2 = new ConcreteObserver("Observer 2", subject);

    subject.setState("State 1");
    subject.setState("State 2");

    subject.detach(observer1);

    subject.setState("State 3");

    // Output:
    // Observer Observer 1 notified. New state is: State 1
    // Observer Observer 2 notified. New state is: State 1
    // Observer Observer 1 notified. New state is: State 2
    // Observer Observer 2 notified. New state is: State 2
    // Observer Observer 2 notified. New state is: State 3
  }
}
```

**Explanation**

1. Subject Interface: Subject interface declares methods for attaching, detaching, and notifying observers.

2. ConcreteSubject Class: This class implements Subject and maintains a list of observers. It updates the observers whenever its state changes.

3. Observer Interface: Observer interface declares the update method that observers must implement.

4. ConcreteObserver Class: This class implements Observer and defines the update method to perform actions when notified by the subject.

5. Client Code: Demonstrates creating a subject and multiple observers, changing the subject's state, and observing the notification process.

### 2. Strategy Pattern

- Encapsulates a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.
- Context: When you need to switch algorithms at runtime without modifying the objects that use them.
- Use case: Payment gateways, shipping cost calculators, and route finding in maps.

### 3. Command Pattern

- Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing different requests to be handled similarly.
- Enables support for undo/redo operations, request queues, and logging.
- Use case: Transaction systems, UI button clicks, macros in text editors.

### 4. Template Method Pattern

- Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but allows subclasses to override specific steps.
- Use case: Sorting algorithms or game logic where certain behaviors are shared but others are specific.

### 5. Iterator Pattern

- Provides a way to sequentially access elements of a collection without exposing its underlying structure.
- Use case: Traversing data structures like lists, trees, or arrays in libraries.

## Deep Dive into Strategy Pattern:

- Definition: A behavioral pattern that defines a set of interchangeable algorithms encapsulated as individual classes. It allows the client to select and change the algorithm at runtime.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Context Class:** Holds a reference to a strategy and allows dynamic algorithm changes.
- **Strategy Interface:** Common interface for all algorithms, ensuring interchangeability.
- **Concrete Strategies:** Implement different algorithms based on the strategy interface.

- **Interview Tip:**
  The Strategy Pattern is often discussed because it promotes the Open/Closed Principle (open for extension, closed for modification). Be prepared to explain how this pattern decouples the algorithm from the client, making it flexible.

**Common Interview Questions:**

#### Q1. Explain the Strategy Pattern and how it works.

- A: The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and allows them to be interchangeable. This pattern helps in selecting algorithms at runtime, promoting flexibility without altering the client code.

#### Q2. What are the advantages of using the Strategy Pattern?

- A:
- **Open/Closed Principle:** You can add new algorithms without modifying the existing context or client code.
- **Decoupling:** The client code does not need to know the details of the algorithm.
- **Flexibility:** Different strategies can be swapped at runtime.

#### Q3. How does the Strategy Pattern differ from the State Pattern?

- A: While the Strategy Pattern encapsulates interchangeable algorithms that are chosen based on the context, the State Pattern focuses on managing an objectâ€™s behavior when its internal state changes.

#### Q4. Provide a real-world example of the Strategy Pattern.

- A: In an online shopping system, different products may have varying shipping cost algorithms (free, fixed, percentage-based). The Strategy Pattern allows switching between these algorithms dynamically.

**Example Code for the Strategy Pattern:**

- **Scenario 1: Shipping Cost Calculator**
  - **Interface:** `ShippingCostCalculator` defines the common method `calculateShippingCost`().
  - **Concrete Strategies:**
    - `FreeShippingCostCalculator` for free shipping.
    - `FixedShippingCostCalculator` for a fixed cost.
    - `PercentageShippingCostCalculator` for percentage-based costs.
- Context: The ShippingCostContext uses a specific calculator strategy to calculate the total shipping cost dynamically.

```java
public interface ShippingCostCalculator {
    double calculateShippingCost(double totalPrice);
}
public class FreeShippingCostCalculator implements ShippingCostCalculator {
    @Override
    public double calculateShippingCost(double totalPrice) {
        return 0.0; // Free shipping for all products
    }
}

public class FixedShippingCostCalculator implements ShippingCostCalculator {
    private double fixedCost;

    public FixedShippingCostCalculator(double fixedCost) {
        this.fixedCost = fixedCost;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateShippingCost(double totalPrice) {
        return fixedCost; // Fixed cost for all products
    }
}

public class PercentageShippingCostCalculator implements ShippingCostCalculator {
    private double percentage;

    public PercentageShippingCostCalculator(double percentage) {
        this.percentage = percentage;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateShippingCost(double totalPrice) {
        return totalPrice * percentage; // Percentage of the total price
    }
}
public class ShippingCostContext {
    private ShippingCostCalculator calculator;

    public ShippingCostContext(ShippingCostCalculator calculator) {
        this.calculator = calculator;
    }

    public double calculateShippingCost(double totalPrice) {
        return calculator.calculateShippingCost(totalPrice);
    }
}
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class ShoppingCart {
    private List < Product > products = new ArrayList < > ();

    public void addProduct(Product product) {
        products.add(product);
    }

    public void removeProduct(Product product) {
        products.remove(product);
    }

    public double getTotalPrice() {
        double totalPrice = 0.0;
        for (Product product: products) {
            totalPrice += product.getPrice();
        }
        return totalPrice;
    }

    public double getShippingCost(ShippingCostCalculator calculator) {
        double totalPrice = getTotalPrice();
        ShippingCostContext context = new ShippingCostContext(calculator);
        return context.calculateShippingCost(totalPrice);
    }
}
public class com.manish.OOD.CreationalDesign.BuilderDesign.Pizza.Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create some products
        Product product1 = new Product("Product 1", 10.0);
        Product product2 = new Product("Product 2", 20.0);
        Product product3 = new Product("Product 3", 30.0);

        // Add products to the cart
        ShoppingCart cart = new ShoppingCart();
        cart.addProduct(product1);
        cart.addProduct(product2);
        cart.addProduct(product3);

        // Calculate the total price and shipping cost
        double totalPrice = cart.getTotalPrice();
        double shippingCost = cart.getShippingCost(new PercentageShippingCostCalculator(0.1)); // 10% of the total price
        double totalCost = totalPrice + shippingCost;

        // Display the results
        System.out.println("Total Price: $" + totalPrice);
        System.out.println("Shipping Cost: $" + shippingCost);
        System.out.println("Total Cost: $" + totalCost);
    }
}
```

#### Example 2:

How to use the Strategy Pattern to calculate the best route on Google Maps using different settings:

First, let's create the interface `RouteCalculator` that defines the common method `calculateRoute`():

```java
public interface RouteCalculator {
    String calculateRoute(Location start, Location end);
}

//Next, let's create the concrete classes that implement this interface for each type of route calculation:
public class FastestRouteCalculator implements RouteCalculator {
    @Override
    public String calculateRoute(Location start, Location end) {
        // Calculate the fastest route using Google Maps API
        return "Fastest route from " + start + " to " + end;
    }
}

public class ShortestRouteCalculator implements RouteCalculator {
    @Override
    public String calculateRoute(Location start, Location end) {
        // Calculate the shortest route using Google Maps API
        return "Shortest route from " + start + " to " + end;
    }
}

public class ScenicRouteCalculator implements RouteCalculator {
    @Override
    public String calculateRoute(Location start, Location end) {
        // Calculate the scenic route using Google Maps API
        return "Scenic route from " + start + " to " + end;
    }
}

//Now, let's create the RouteCalculatorContext class that accepts a specific RouteCalculator and uses it to calculate the best route:
public class RouteCalculatorContext {
    private RouteCalculator calculator;

    public RouteCalculatorContext(RouteCalculator calculator) {
        this.calculator = calculator;
    }

    public String calculateRoute(Location start, Location end) {
        return calculator.calculateRoute(start, end);
    }
}

//Finally, let's create the GoogleMaps class that uses the RouteCalculatorContext to calculate the best route using different settings:
public class GoogleMaps {
    private RouteCalculatorContext context;

    public GoogleMaps(RouteCalculator calculator) {
        this.context = new RouteCalculatorContext(calculator);
    }

    public void setRouteCalculator(RouteCalculator calculator) {
        this.context = new RouteCalculatorContext(calculator);
    }

    public String calculateRoute(Location start, Location end) {
        return context.calculateRoute(start, end);
    }
}

//Here's how you can use these classes to calculate the best route on Google Maps using different settings:
public class com.manish.OOD.CreationalDesign.BuilderDesign.Pizza.Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Google Maps instance with the default calculator (fastest route)
        GoogleMaps maps = new GoogleMaps(new FastestRouteCalculator());

        // Calculate the best route from New York to Boston using the default calculator
        Location start = new Location("New York");
        Location end = new Location("Boston");
        String route = maps.calculateRoute(start, end);
        System.out.println(route);

        // Change the calculator to the shortest route
        maps.setRouteCalculator(new ShortestRouteCalculator());

        // Calculate the best route from New York to Boston using the shortest route calculator
        route = maps.calculateRoute(start, end);
        System.out.println(route);

        // Change the calculator to the scenic route
        maps.setRouteCalculator(new ScenicRouteCalculator());

        // Calculate the best route from New York to Boston using the scenic route calculator
        route = maps.calculateRoute(start, end);
        System.out.println(route);
    }
}
```

#### Example 3:

Let's say we have a mobile application that needs to send push notifications to its users. The application needs to support multiple platforms such as iOS, Android, and Windows. Each platform has its own way of sending push notifications. We can use the Strategy Pattern to implement this functionality.

```java

// First, let's create the interface PushNotificationStrategy that defines the common method sendPushNotification():
public interface PushNotificationStrategy {
    void sendPushNotification(String message);
}

// Next, let's create the concrete classes that implement this interface for each platform:
public class IOSPushNotificationStrategy implements PushNotificationStrategy {
    @Override
    public void sendPushNotification(String message) {
        // Send push notification using iOS push notification service
        System.out.println("Sending push notification to iOS devices: " + message);
    }
}

public class AndroidPushNotificationStrategy implements PushNotificationStrategy {
    @Override
    public void sendPushNotification(String message) {
        // Send push notification using Android push notification service
        System.out.println("Sending push notification to Android devices: " + message);
    }
}

public class WindowsPushNotificationStrategy implements PushNotificationStrategy {
    @Override
    public void sendPushNotification(String message) {
        // Send push notification using Windows push notification service
        System.out.println("Sending push notification to Windows devices: " + message);
    }
}

// Now, let's create the PushNotificationContext class that accepts a specific
PushNotificationStrategy and uses it to send push notifications:
public class PushNotificationContext {
    private PushNotificationStrategy strategy;

    public PushNotificationContext(PushNotificationStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void setStrategy(PushNotificationStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void sendPushNotification(String message) {
        strategy.sendPushNotification(message);
    }
}

// Finally, let's create the MobileApp class that uses the PushNotificationContext to send push notifications to its users on different platforms:
public class MobileApp {
    private PushNotificationContext context;

    public MobileApp(PushNotificationStrategy strategy) {
        this.context = new PushNotificationContext(strategy);
    }

    public void setPushNotificationStrategy(PushNotificationStrategy strategy) {
        this.context.setStrategy(strategy);
    }

    public void sendPushNotification(String message) {
        context.sendPushNotification(message);
    }
}

// Here's how you can use these classes to send push notifications to users on different platforms:
public class com.manish.OOD.CreationalDesign.BuilderDesign.Pizza.Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a mobile app instance with the default push notification strategy (iOS)
        MobileApp app = new MobileApp(new IOSPushNotificationStrategy());

        // Send push notification to all users using the default strategy (iOS)
        app.sendPushNotification("New update available!");

        // Change the push notification strategy to Android
        app.setPushNotificationStrategy(new AndroidPushNotificationStrategy());

        // Send push notification to all users using the Android strategy
        app.sendPushNotification("New update available!");

        // Change the push notification strategy to Windows
        app.setPushNotificationStrategy(new WindowsPushNotificationStrategy());

        // Send push notification to all users using the Windows strategy
        app.sendPushNotification("New update available!");
    }
}
```

#### Key Interview Takeaways:

1. **When to Use Strategy Pattern:**

- When you need to swap between multiple algorithms dynamically.
- When different algorithms share the same input-output structure but differ in implementation.

2. **Difference Between Strategy and Factory Patterns:**

- **Strategy** deals with interchangeable algorithms, while Factory patterns focus on object creation.

3. **How Strategy Enhances Flexibility:**

- Allows the introduction of new algorithms without altering existing system code.
- Supports runtime selection of the best suited algorithm for the current context.

#### Additional Practical Scenarios:

1. **Google Maps Route Calculation:**
   Strategies for the fastest, shortest, and scenic routes can be switched depending on user preferences.
2. **Push Notifications in Mobile Apps:**
   Different strategies for sending push notifications on iOS, Android, and Windows platforms.

## Observer Design Pattern

#### Overview:

- The **Observer Design Pattern defines a one-to-many relationship** between objects so that when the state of one object (subject) changes, all its dependent objects (observers) are notified and updated automatically.

- **Key Features:**

  - **Decoupling:** The pattern promotes loose coupling between the subject and observers.
  - **Event-driven:** Useful in event-driven systems where multiple components need to react to a state change or event.
  - **Scalability:** New observers can be added or removed without modifying the subject.

**Common Use Cases:**

> - **Event handling:** When an event occurs (e.g., button click), all registered observers are notified to take appropriate action.
> - **User interface components:** Changes in UI components (e.g., checkbox state) can trigger actions in multiple observers.
> - **Stock market data:** Notifies observers (like graphs or alerts) whenever stock prices change.
> - **Weather monitoring:** Observers are notified of changes in weather data like temperature, humidity, or pressure, and can update displays accordingly.
> - **Database management systems:** When the state of a database changes (e.g., a record is updated), the registered observers can take actions like updating caches or notifying users.

### Key Benefits:

- `Decouples` subject and observers.
- **Highly flexible:** New observers can be added without changing the subject.
- **Scalable:** Useful in scenarios where multiple components need to react to state changes.
